Read this to install, and please follow all of the steps so that the custom crosshair works correctly. 

First, you want to move this file into your 

Programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/teamfortress2/tf/custom folder

Next, navigate to the Programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/teamfortress2/tf/custom/Kyle-Hud-Master/resource folder. 
Here you will find a filed named "Tf2default". This is a font file. Right click on it, and then click "install" to install the font. 
The Hud WILL NOT WORK unless you do this. 

Next, you must click on the "fonts" folder located in Programfilesx86/steam/steamapps/common/teamfortress2/tf/custom/Kyle-Hud-Master/resource
Select all of the fonts in this folder, right click, and install. If you have downloaded versions of m0rehud in the past and already have
some of these fonts installed, just write over them to be safe. 

Once you have completed all of these steps, you should be able to launch the hud with the custom crosshair working. 
If it does not work, make sure you have all the fonts installed, especially tf2default. 

If you have any questions pertainig the hud and its installation, please contact Giuseppe at http://steamcommunity.com/id/GiuseppeSaroni/
or you can contact fanom at http://steamcommunity.com/id/146636510/ 

crosshair from Giuseppe guide by Fanom.

Thanks, and enjoy.
